[mod-description]
tackleautorun=This mod lets you autorun, autowalk, automove, whatever we call it. Let your fingers rest, avoid RSI!\n\nYou start by walking and then press a dedicated button to latch the movement (default mouse button 5).\nYou then cancel the automatic movement by either moving in any direction, or by pressing a dedicated 'stop move' key (default mouse button 4)\n\nYou might want to rebind the buttons to something that suits you better. Also note that if you have the map view open and use the movement keys you will cancel out the autorunning. Pan the map with the mouse in that case instead.\n\nIf you have any issues please raise them on github.\n\nNOTE: After 0.17 update Factorio has default binds to both buttons mouse 4 and 5. This mod collides on that bind, so either figure out something suitable for yourself or do what I did - unbind the default game binds on those buttons.
